        <Summary>Clear Sans Fonts - TrueType</Summary>
        <Description>Adopted by Mozilla for the Firefox for Android browser, Clear Sans has been recognized as a versatile OpenType font for screen, print, and Web. Clear Sans was designed with on-screen legibility in mind. It strikes a balance between contemporary, professional, and stylish expression and thoroughly functional purpose. It has a sophisticated and elegant personality at all sizes, and its thoughtful design becomes even more evident at the thin weight.</Description>
